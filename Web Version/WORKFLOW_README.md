# File Encryption & Decryption Workflow

This document explains how the file encryption and decryption process works in your application.

## 1. High-Level Overview

The application uses a symmetric encryption approach where the same key (password) is used for both locking and unlocking files. To handle multiple files easily, it automatically bundles them into a ZIP archive before encryption.

## 2. Encryption Workflow

When a user uploads files to be encrypted:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Browser
    participant Server (Django View)
    participant Locker (Encryption Logic)
    participant Database

    User->>Browser: Selects files & enters Password
    Browser->>Server: POST / (files, key, algo='xor', action='encrypt')
    
    Server->>Server: Bundle files into ZIP (in-memory)
    
    Server->>Locker: encrypt_data(zip_data, key, algo)
    Locker->>Locker: Hash Key (SHA-256)
    Locker->>Locker: Prepend Signature ("LOCKER_V1")
    Locker->>Locker: Apply Algorithm (e.g., XOR)
    Locker-->>Server: Return Encrypted Bytes

        Note over Server, Database: If User is Authenticated
        Server->>Database: Save FileHistory (filename, action='encrypt')
    end
    
    Server-->>Browser: Return "locked_files.zip.enc" as Download
    Browser-->>User: User saves encrypted file
```

### Detailed Steps:
1.  **Input**: User selects one or multiple files and provides a password (key).
2.  **Zipping**: The server takes all uploaded files and compresses them into a single ZIP file in memory. This ensures that even if you upload 10 files, you only get 1 encrypted file back.
3.  **Key Hashing**: The password provided is hashed using SHA-256. This is a security best practice so the raw password isn't used directly, and it ensures a fixed-length key.
4.  **Signature**: A special marker `LOCKER_V1` is added to the beginning of the data. This acts like a stamp to verify later that the file was indeed encrypted by this system and with the correct password.
5.  **Encryption**: The selected algorithm (XOR, Base64, or both) transforms the data into an unreadable format.
6.  **Output**: The user downloads a single `.enc` file.

## 3. Decryption Workflow

When a user uploads an encrypted file to be decrypted:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Browser
    participant Server (Django View)
    participant Locker (Decryption Logic)
    participant Database

    User->>Browser: Uploads .enc file & enters Password
    Browser->>Server: POST / (file, key, algo, action='decrypt')
    
    Server->>Locker: decrypt_data(file_data, key, algo)
    Locker->>Locker: Hash Key (SHA-256)
    Locker->>Locker: Apply Reverse Algorithm
    Locker->>Locker: Verify Signature ("LOCKER_V1")
    
    alt Signature Valid
        Locker-->>Server: Return Decrypted ZIP Bytes
        
        rect rgb(240, 248, 255)
            Note over Server, Database: If User is Authenticated
            Server->>Database: Save FileHistory (filename, action='decrypt')
        end
        
        Server-->>Browser: Return "unlocked_files.zip" as Download
    else Signature Invalid / Wrong Password
        Locker-->>Server: Raise Error
        Server-->>Browser: Show Error Message ("Invalid password or corrupted file")
    end
```

### Detailed Steps:
1.  **Input**: User uploads the `.enc` file and enters the same password used for encryption.
2.  **Processing**: The server reads the encrypted file.
3.  **Decryption**: The system attempts to reverse the encryption using the provided key and algorithm.
4.  **Verification**: It checks for the `LOCKER_V1` signature.
    *   **Success**: If the signature is found, it means the password was correct. The signature is removed, and the original ZIP data is restored.
    *   **Failure**: If the signature is missing or garbage, it means the wrong password was used or the file is corrupted. The process stops and shows an error.
5.  **Output**: The user receives the original `unlocked_files.zip` containing their data.

## 4. Key Code Components

*   **`locker_app/views.py`**: Handles the web request, zipping files, and managing the HTTP response.
*   **`locker_app/locker.py`**: Contains the core logic for `encrypt_data` and `decrypt_data`, including the math for XOR and Base64 operations.
